# Assignment 3: ADTs and Testing

Changes to ADT:
    Added the minimum() and maximum() functions to the implementation This required two new
    state variables __min and __max which are initially set to None. When data arrives these
    are overwritten.

    Handling logic was needed for being unable to handle these as numeric inputs and the initial
    case of transitioning types. In addition add() was extended to handle the new state.

    Test cases were added to a4q2_testing to test how the initial values and operations worked
    around empty/near-empty initialized structures. This included expanding the expected values 
    for testOperations()
