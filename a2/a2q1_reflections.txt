1) How long did it take for you to create your plan?

About 15 minutes, most of that was spent understanding the various requirements and how to structure
the code into manageable segments for handling multiple axis.

2) Did you revise your design? In other words, did any part of your implementation turn out to be 
   significantly different from your design? If so, briefly explain the reason for the difference(s)

Not the design, it was fairly well thought out. The only snag I had with the implementation was for
displaying multiple-pair data to be in line with the output expected by the assignment. As there
wasn't a specified way to output multi-pair data I just dumped the dictionary to the console.

3) Did any of the phases take signicantly longer than you had planned? 
   If so, explain what happened,and suggest ways to avoid this in the future

The design phase took longer then I would have thought. But by the time I had prepared a decent structure
for the project the implementation phase took less time and didn't require rewriting. In the future more
time should be allocated to designing and less for implementing
