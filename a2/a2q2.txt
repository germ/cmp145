1) Comment on you programs correctness

Program passes all tests and outputs correct data. Handles garbage input and doesn't hard crash from 
what I can tell. I've made a good effort to break my program and stop it from happening again. More
test cases (and more variety) would raise this confidence. Most programs are incorrect in some way,
this one is no different. Until a user tries to break it themselves, I believe it is bug-free

2) Comment on you programs efficiency

Program loops over each file exactly once, cleaning open FDs as it goes. Input is scanned n times 
(with n being the size of the pairs array). For small n this will be fine, but for larger walks and
pair sets a single scan and updating the return dictionary as it scans would be ideal. For the given
set of data the program runs in 3ms including setup/teardown, the unix time command was used to get this
data.

3) Comment on you programs adaptability
The program is easily adaptable, and can handle multiple pairs. This is currently governed by a single 
array 'axis' in main that contains the pair tuples to check for. If this is extended to have other values
they are scanned as well and the output modified to display them. In addition the getDistance() function 
is currently a one-liner, but could be adapted in various ways. Pythons typing module was used to make a 
simple well defined interface for extending this code.

4) Comment on you programs robustness
The program handles wrong inputs and usage fairly well. File IO is wrapped to catch exceptions, the code
was tested against various input and pythons typing module was used to ensure values are of the correct
types and minimize runtime errors. The only problem I see with regards to robustness is reading files myself
instead of piping them in and relying on the underlying OS to open/read/network. 

5) Comment on interruptions
The biggest distraction was between my cat and noise from my girlfriend setting up a couch. These were minor
annoyances at best and I was able to get back into work easily. In the future a good pair of headphones and 
closing the door would help with interruptions.
