# a1q2: Verify Latin Squares

1) I am fairly confident that the program is correct. Testing was done with additional hand-crafted smaller
squares/test cases and the method used for verification is sound. The one thing this program doesn't handle 
is bad data being loaded from the files (i.e. invalid dimensions).

2) I started with a rough skeleton by factoring out what would need to be reused in the program and writing 
a general flow with comments. I started with manually loading a test case to verifySquares(), and implementing
the various checks. Once that was done I moved on to the main routine and implemented file IO and ran more 
general checks.

3) Maybe an hour. Most of it was spent debugging the filter/mapping and using set() as a way to find unique
values. It took longer then expected due to the overuse of compact one-liners and list expressions. For more 
maintainable code these would be expanded into more pythonic expressions. 

4) I almost require a typing system during development, and have been working with mypy/type annotations to 
bridge the gap. Eventually I'll become more comfortable with the nature of dynamic languages and keeping the
implied types in my head.
