Question 1:
copy1():
  - Does not make a deep copy (dst has same address as src)
  - Not suitable if preserving src is required
  - Suitable if destruction of src is acceptable

copy2():
  - Generates a array from 0-len(src) integers
  - Does not copy src data 
  - Not suitable for any kind of copying

copy3():
  - Errors out when used
  - Even if fixed, src data is removed 
  - Not suitable/working

copy4():
  - Scope issues prevent modification of passed dst
  - Not suitable/working

copy5():
  - Array is properly constructed, but only the local reference to copy is updated
  - Not suitable/working
